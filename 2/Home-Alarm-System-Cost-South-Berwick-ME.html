<p>The Ring Alarm system also has a self-monitoring option, something that's unusual amongst expertly set up systems. That indicates even if you do not pay the regular monthly fee, the system will still notify you through your mobile phone if it discovers a risk, but you are responsible for getting in touch with emergency situation services such as the authorities or fire department-- so your phone needs to remain on and you need to be ready to field alerts, even at 2:00 a.m. It's good that the system has a monitoring choice, though, in case you don't constantly desire that duty, such as when you're on trip.</p>
