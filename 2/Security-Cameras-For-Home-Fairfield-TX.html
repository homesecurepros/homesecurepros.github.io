<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it provides protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air".

In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only an incorrect complacency because it prevents just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
