With a self-monitored system, a house owner will not receive calls from a monitoring company. Instead, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the essential action.</p>

<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can determine people the camera is finding using face recognition. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those people and will send out smart device informs with that information when they appear at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also supply a wider range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
