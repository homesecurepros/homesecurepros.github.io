<p>After checking dozens of wired and wireless options, the best home security camera for most people is the Arlo Pro 2. It tape-records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is fully wireless, and can be set up both inside and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint doesn't have an agreement, and its equipment pricing is incredibly sensible, so it's not a total splurge. But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>

Hope this helps.</p>

And although we appreciate geofencing, we had several mistakes with that feature during testing.</p>

It ended up being an incorrect alarm-- one she paid the local authorities $150 for.</p>
