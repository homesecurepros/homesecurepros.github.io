<p>The Blink XT2 is small, runs on two AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of totally free cloud storage, and it captures a better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a pick? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, mobile phone alerts and live views were painfully slow, and the variety is poor.
