<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents talking to somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered.

<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to sign in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We initially observed Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we attempted it out, it rapidly ended up being a staff (and friends and family) fave. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send notifies, you can't manage it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
