You can utilize it even without a Ring alarm system, and if you have a Ring camera, you can publish and share clips of suspicious activity or lost animals.</p>

<p>Recently, Ring denied reports that it had suffered a data breach, but we agree with its recommendation that users ought to reset passwords and allow two-factor authentication as a preventive procedure. All smart-home devices are vulnerable to such occurrences. However, after this newest entry in a year-long series of controversial media reports, we have actually decided to pull our suggestion of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially read the What about Ring? section from our wise video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video products, we don't believe that these problems alter the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay confident in our present recommendation.</p>
