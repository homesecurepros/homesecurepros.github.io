<p>When mounting cameras inside your house isn't a choice, you might wish to check out hidden cameras, which are cameras that are small and discreet, in some cases suited daily objects such as clocks, smoke detectors, and magnets. If you need to document an essential meeting in a public location, a personal hidden camera constructed into a watch or pen might be a good option.

<p>The Canary Flex features a smart variation that sends alerts straight to your phone if you're looking for motion detection. This camera uses a wide variety of features including a 360-degree swiveling base. Last time I evaluated a Swann camera I explained it as distinctly middle of the road. Not fantastic, not dreadful, but with an actually simple setup process (and trust me, that really is a killer function when it comes to clever cameras.) This newer version is much the same, to be frank.</p>
<p>When I eventually got into the camera controls, I was fairly impressed. The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a strong night-vision mode, and all the app controls are fairly self-explanatory. You have actually got two-way audio, you can play tunes simply to let the person being viewed know they're being seen, and you can select to tape-record video clips or photos and conserve them to your clever gadget on a whim. </p>
