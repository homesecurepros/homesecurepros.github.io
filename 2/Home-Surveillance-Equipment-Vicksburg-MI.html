<p>Costs for systems differ. Bigger systems that offer full-house protection with expert monitoring are the most expensive alternatives. Smaller sized, self-monitored systems are the most budget-friendly option. Bear in mind that cameras with two-way audio generally work like walkie talkies. You push a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's taking place on the other end.

<p>I explained that all we would require to do is tap into any among the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, and that camera would become the user interface into the VMS system. When a patient pushes the emergency situation button, it sends double signals: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Moreover, if the main patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the risk and, if required, could just push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular floor.</p>
