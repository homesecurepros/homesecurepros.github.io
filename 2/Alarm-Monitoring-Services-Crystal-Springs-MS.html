At 80dB, it has to do with as loud as a food processor whereas numerous other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB or perhaps 105dB. Despite that, the alarm must be enough to scare away burglars for the most part. To recoup costs and hold alarm companies responsible for incorrect alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company rather of with you.
