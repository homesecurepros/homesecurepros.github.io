<h3>In House Security Systems Raton NM 87740</h3>
<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to check in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We initially observed Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we attempted it out, it rapidly became a staff (and friends and family) favorite. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send signals, you can't manage it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
<p>This self monitored alarm has 4 smart modes-- Home, Away, Night, and Personal. Based on that, the camera turns on or off depending on your area. The camera records 1080p videos with a 147-degree large angle lens that reduces all blind areas and offers you access to a broader field of vision than the majority of cameras. It is also equipped with a 3x digital zoom function that permits you to zoom in and capture information such as facial functions in case of break-ins.</p>
<p>You can select from SimpliSafe's original acclaimed system or their most recent line of equipment. Both systems offer outstanding, trustworthy home security. With the newer system, you will pay more, however that higher cost features a system that is smaller, quicker, and stronger. At half the size of the initial system, the small sensors are practically unnoticeable. The new system works 5 times much faster, and the alarm is 50% louder to scare off trespassers. </p>
