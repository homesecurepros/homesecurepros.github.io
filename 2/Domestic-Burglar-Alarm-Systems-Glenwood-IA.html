<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the same spot and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather condition.

However, you might select to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is typically provided for cameras that are monitoring indoor, houses). Cameras that are not monitored by the central station can not be accessed our operators for any reason, even if requested by the customer. </p>
