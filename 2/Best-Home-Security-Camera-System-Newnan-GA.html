<p>Absolutely nothing is more vital than protecting what you treasure most ... your family and home. The implicit validation for the current push to increase video surveillance is the danger of terrorist attacks. But suicide assailants are clearly not hindered by camera - and may even be attracted to the television protection cameras can make sure - and the cost of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up approximately 20 percent of that country's criminal justice budget - far surpasses the limited advantages that the system may supply in investigating attacks or tried attacks after the fact (see truth sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>

When a client presses the emergency situation button, it sends double alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Moreover, if the main patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the danger and, if required, could simply push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular floor.</p>
