<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it supplies protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software to identify it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just a false complacency since it prevents just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
