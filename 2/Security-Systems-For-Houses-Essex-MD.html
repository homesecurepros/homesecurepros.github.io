<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the harsh environment.</p>
<p>We liked Alder for their fast reaction times and total adaptability. And controlling our system with their touchscreen panel was pretty darn and uncomplicated streamlined.

Provided all of the other benefits, it's simple to see why so many people are picking this choice. </p>
