<h2>Benefits Of A Wireless Home Security Camera System Green Bay</h2>

With the long USB cord, I was able location the camera around 10 feet away from my desk intending into my hallway. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which had the ability to discover the camera without problem. The IR lights in the evening are able to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle.

<h3>Wireless Security Alarm in Green Bay WI</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
