<p>The disadvantage to a wireless system is that it relies on a wireless signal, implying that storms and strong winds have the power to disrupt the system and might even trigger false alarms. False alarms are known to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could lead to fines from the provider or the police if they take place often enough. Another possible drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment must be changed or charged frequently in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is usually offset by the truth that there are no installation costs.</p>
