<p>According to a report, homes that don't have a security system are three times most likely to be robbed. Brinks owns and runs its own US-based monitoring center. Its monitoring service consists of a benefit called ASAPer, which simultaneously messages a group of pre-set contacts to determine whether alarm activity is a real emergency or incorrect alarm. Most monitoring center call household members one at a time, which can slow response times.</p>
<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents talking with someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is set off. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are fairly typical.

With an expertly monitored system, the house owner will be contacted by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it quickly. Incorrect alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a property owner won't get calls from a monitoring company. Rather, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the required action.</p>
