<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally normal given that the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
