It tapes high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is fully wireless, and can be established both indoors and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint doesn't have a contract, and its equipment rates is extremely affordable, so it's not an overall splurge. However you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the similarity Vivint or Brinks.</p>

Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we do not recommend it considering that its battery-saving regimens can interrupt performance.</p>
