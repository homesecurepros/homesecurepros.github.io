<p>While some parts may be affected for a short while by a power blackout, cellular and landline systems will continue to work even if there's no electricity. Cellular systems use cell towers to interact with the monitoring center in addition to a battery backup that can keep them up and running for a number of hours until the electrical service is brought back. Landline systems use conventional phone lines to communicate with the monitoring center and, just like cellular systems, they usually have a battery backup to keep them working for a set time period.</p>
<p>Registered for service for my Simon XTi and was active with their service an hour later. The company that installed my alarm went out of business so I was on the hunt for a new monitoring company. These people are $18 a month more affordable and stayed in business 3 decades so I'm comfortable providing a shot. Wish I had looked earlier but frankly didnt realize I could conserve money up until forced to look when my dealership folded.</p>
