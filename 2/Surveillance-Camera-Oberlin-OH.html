<p>If you use Alexa to control the smart lights in your home, then you must think about experimenting with Alexa Guard, a fairly new home security mode with a couple of cool tricks. After turning Guard Mode on in the Alexa app's settings, simply state, "Alexa, I'm leaving" as you walk out the door to activate it. From there, Alexa will cycle your lights on and off to make it look like you're home - and you'll also get an alert if your Echo speakers hear the sound of an alarm, or broken glass.</p>
<p>The integration of digital video surveillance and gain access to control is part of the natural convergence of security innovations. Centralizing security into a single user interface provides additional information that may never have been possible in the past, such as notification of a worker, by name and recognition number, getting in the structure. A picture of that worker exists on screen for verification (verifying it's not a stolen ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, guaranteeing no tailgating takes place.</p>

Obviously, DVRs need analog cameras, while NVRs utilize IP cameras, however the compatibility question extends well beyond that distinction. Some NVR systems, for instance, work with the IP cameras just from particular makers and not others.

The cameras should be able to provide you with the needed details if you're working with a surveillance system integrator to configure your system.</p>
