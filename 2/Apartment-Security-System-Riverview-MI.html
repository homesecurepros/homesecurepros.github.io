<p>The downside to a wireless system is that it depends on a wireless signal, meaning that storms and strong winds have the power to interfere with the system and could even trigger false alarms. False alarms are known to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could result in fines from the provider or the cops if they happen often enough. Another potential disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool must be changed or charged regularly in order to keep the system working.
