<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can recognize individuals the camera is identifying using face acknowledgment. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name.

We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to distinguish predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to identify faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) likewise supply a wider variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
