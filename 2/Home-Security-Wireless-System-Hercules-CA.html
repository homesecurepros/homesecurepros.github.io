So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no concept I was in, to get out I need to pay $783.  Actually irritating. Again the sales individuals, or at least mine, do not discuss the 3 year commitment. I called their customer care team and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to mention it, it's on you to check out the small print. I'm paying the swelling sum, because obviously they vehicle restore you at some time unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send in a written not by mail.
