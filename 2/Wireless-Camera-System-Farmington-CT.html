<p>A system that requires an agreement might be a smart choice for those who are cash-strapped or do not want to spend for the equipment up-front. Why?

We've seen 1-year, all the way approximately 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we suggest contract-free systems if you do not wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting agreement (and who does?). Our pick: No contract.</p>

<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive plan, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and features are almost identical to those of the Brinks system.
