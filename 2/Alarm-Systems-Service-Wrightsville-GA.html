<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  If you wish to get out of the agreement you need to pay 75% of the contract.  So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no concept I was in, to go out I have to pay $783.  Actually annoying. Again the sales people, or at least mine, do not point out the 3 year commitment. I called their customer support group and they acknowledged that the sales people do not need to discuss it, it's on you to check out the small print. I'm paying the swelling amount, due to the fact that apparently they auto restore you eventually unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send in a written not by mail.  ADT is a problem, method too costly, and not excellent.</p>
<p>There are 2 outdoor security camera styles - dome or bullet-shaped. Since they provide a 360 swivel that makes it tough to identify their direction, the dome-shaped outdoor security camera is known to be less apparent to undesirable visitors. On the other hand, bullet-shaped cameras are more common. They have a cylinder shape that plainly stands apart to alert thieves that your home is under surveillance.</p>
<p>The cost of admission for the Deep Guard Home Security system isn't that steep, even at $499, since it consists of 3 outdoor cameras with two-way audio. And the $50-per-month subscription cost sounds costly, however it's not a lot when you consider that a live human being is viewing a live feed whenever the cameras find suspicious activity. That person at Deep Sentinel's center can alert a suspicious individual that they're being observed, and they can call your local authorities dispatcher if they refuse to leave or engage in a criminal act. It's not for everybody, but it's the best Do It Yourself outdoor security camera we have actually seen to date.</p>
