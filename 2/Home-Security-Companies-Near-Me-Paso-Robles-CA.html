<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids talking to somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is set off. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are relatively typical. If a house owner forgets their secrets and returns inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is triggered by a community cat, it can trigger the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the homeowner will be contacted by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it rapidly. False alarms take place.
