<p>A wired security camera can come in 2 kinds, both needing wires to provide power and for the functions of video transmission. The camera's seeing angle determines just how much space the camera will cover. Wide-angle lenses decrease the number of cameras required to monitor your home. Some outdoor security cameras have a wide-angle lens that might show a 360-degree view, but the best security cameras have a view of at least 100 degrees or better.</p>
<p>A tight wire boundary security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to find any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to neglect objects that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to avoid this kind of attack.</p>

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally typical considering that the doorway and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
