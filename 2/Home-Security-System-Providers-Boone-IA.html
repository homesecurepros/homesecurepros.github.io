<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids speaking to someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is set off. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are relatively typical. If a homeowner forgets their secrets and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is set off by a neighborhood cat, it can set off the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the house owner will be contacted by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it rapidly. Incorrect alarms take place. With a self-monitored system, a homeowner won't receive calls from a monitoring company. Instead, homeowners access the alarm themselves and take the needed action.</p>
<h2>How Home Security Systems Work Boone</h2>

<p>If you utilize Alexa to control the smart lights in your home, then you ought to consider checking out Alexa Guard, a fairly new home security mode with a number of neat tricks. After turning Guard Mode on in the Alexa app's settings, simply say, "Alexa, I'm leaving" as you leave the door to trigger it. From there, Alexa will cycle your lights on and off to make it appear like you're home - and you'll also get a notice if your Echo speakers hear the sound of an alarm, or broken glass.</p>
<p>Recording the video footage from your security cameras needs hard disk drives or cloud based storage. The digital video recorder (DVR) that the security cameras are connected to has a difficult drive inside of it if you have an analog security camera system. If your dealing with recorded video storage on an IP camera system, then your network video recorder (NVR) can utilize hard disks for on-site recording and cloud-based recording in the event of hard drive breakdown.</p>
