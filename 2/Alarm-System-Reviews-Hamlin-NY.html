<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally regular given that the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when clients realize that the economical customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
<p>What really sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be expensive but is essential. In fact, we don't advise buying this camera at all unless you plan to include the subscription. Without it, you won't get the person-detection feature, personalized Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, a detailed, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera detected activity. Being able to distinguish between a person and a vehicle, for instance, enables you to reduce unneeded signals. And Activity Zones are a nice perk, specifically if you're aiming to monitor a particular corner of the backyard, a doorway, and even garbage cans. </p>
