<p>Bear in mind that Nest cameras aren't professionally monitored-- that part's on you. (The remainder of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.) But given that a lot of retail theft wouldn't journey an alarm anyhow (a worker slipping some additional cash while offering a customer change, for example), we think it's more vital to have top quality images so you have the evidence you need.

<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the same spot and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting components, which I had actually set up on the deck by a licensed electrician (who occurs to be my other half). All of the cameras were connected to the same 2.4 GHz network by means of a Wi-Fi router inside (approximately 40 feet from the cameras); service to your house was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can identify individuals the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those people and will send out smartphone notifies with that details when they show up at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to distinguish expected visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise found the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to identify faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also supply a broader series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
