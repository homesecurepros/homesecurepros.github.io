<p>The Residence Smart Security Package, our previous runner-up, is still a solid choice for some people. Home has updated that variation with 4G cellular backup and an onboard Z-Wave 500 Series chip, which offers a much better variety for sensing units. Both the initial Residence system and the House Iota work with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, however the Iota is the only model we checked that also works with HomeKit.
