We have actually seen 1-year, all the method as much as 5-year contracts!

<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a short explanation of how thermal cameras work: All items release infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature. The infrared energy released by an object is known as its heat signature. In general, the hotter an item is, the more radiation it gives off. A thermal camera consists of a heat sensor that can detecting tiny distinctions in temperature level. The device gathers the infrared radiation from objects in the scene and develops an electronic image based upon information about the temperature level distinctions. Because objects are hardly ever exactly the same temperature level as other items around them, a thermal camera can identify them, and they will appear as distinct in a thermal image.</p>

The signal is compressed 5:1, but DVD quality can be attained with more compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a higher compression ratio than 5:1, with a slightly lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the quantity of space to be used up versus the quality of picture needed or desired). The greatest picture quality of DVD is only somewhat lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>

<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can identify people the camera is finding using face recognition. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those people and will send mobile phone alerts with that info when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to distinguish anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
