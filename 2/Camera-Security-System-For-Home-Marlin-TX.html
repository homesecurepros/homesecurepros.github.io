<p>Wireless systems, on the other hand, typically utilize battery-powered transmitters which are simpler to install and have less costly start-up expenses, but might stop working if the batteries are not preserved. Depending on distance and building and construction products, several wireless repeaters may be needed to bring the signal to the alarm panel dependably. A wireless system can be transferred to a new home quickly, an advantage for those who rent or who move often. The more important wireless connection for security is the one in between the control panel and the monitoring station. Wireless monitoring of the alarm system safeguards against a burglar cutting a cable television or from failures of an internet provider. This full wireless setup is commonly described as 100% wireless.</p>

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do these days - you will probably be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the large quantity of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and typically over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are dependable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, removing the requirement for further circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might need less circuitry in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera separately, normally via 110VAC power. </p>
