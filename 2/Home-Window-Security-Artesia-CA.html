Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky.

<p>The disadvantage to a wireless system is that it relies on a wireless signal, implying that storms and strong winds have the power to disrupt the system and could even activate incorrect alarms. Incorrect alarms are understood to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might lead to fines from the provider or the police if they occur frequently enough. Another potential disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool should be replaced or charged routinely in order to keep the system working.
