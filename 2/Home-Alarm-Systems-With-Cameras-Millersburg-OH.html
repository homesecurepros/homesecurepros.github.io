<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can identify people the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those people and will send out smart device informs with that information when they show up at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to identify predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise found the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also supply a wider variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
