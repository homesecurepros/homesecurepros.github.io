<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most technologically advanced outdoor camera we have actually tested. It has a close-up tracking function, which instantly zooms in on motion and then follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high vibrant range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between general motion and people, so it reduces incorrect alarms, and it can even determine individuals you have actually labeled (after a learning period). However like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
<p>What really sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be pricey however is necessary.

Being able to compare a vehicle and a person, for example, allows you to reduce unnecessary alerts. And Activity Zones are a good perk, especially if you're wanting to monitor a particular corner of the lawn, a doorway, or perhaps trash bin. </p>
