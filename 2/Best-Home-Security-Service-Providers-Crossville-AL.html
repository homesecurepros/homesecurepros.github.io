<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced features, such as alerts that distinguish between people and basic motion. We think that's pricey.</p>

Lots of sites requiring alarm installations no longer have standard telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with traditional telephone dialer capability do not work dependably over some types of VoIP service.</p>
