It tapes high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is completely wireless, and can be established both inside and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have an agreement, and its equipment pricing is extremely affordable, so it's not a total splurge. However you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>

Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to find any physical effort to permeate the barrier.
