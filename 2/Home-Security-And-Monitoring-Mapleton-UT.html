<p>Are independently owned, operated surveillance cameras to be treated the same method as public cameras? We also need to draw fine lines about 'Who truly is enjoying you'? 'Who owns that camera anyhow'? Big sibling? The Corporates? Or bugging neighbour? Who fixes a limit between public interest and harassment? At the moment, nobody! The camera could lawfully do what a peeping tom could refrain from doing. They could peer within windows with the full protection of the law on their side. If a person was standing seeing outside a window it could be a crime, yet the very same person might put a surveillance camera then remotely view an individual within the privacy of their home. Most significantly, it is not versus the penal code.</p>
