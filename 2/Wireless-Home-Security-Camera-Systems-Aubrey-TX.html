<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can identify people the camera is spotting using face recognition. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those individuals and will send out smartphone signals with that information when they appear at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate predicted visitors from random strangers. We likewise found the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) likewise supply a wider series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
