<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally typical because the doorway and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
