<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your home so we might point them at the exact same area and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting components, which I had installed on the patio by a licensed electrical expert (who happens to be my partner). All of the cameras were connected to the exact same 2.4 GHz network by means of a Wi-Fi router indoors (roughly 40 feet from the cameras); service to your home was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>We tried each of the cameras in several areas around our house, varying from 6 feet to 30 feet far from our Wi-Fi router, which was linked to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we checked each camera utilizing an iOS device (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) along with an Android smart device (using a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint provides a wide range of equipment and home automation items at an affordable rate, the one area where the company especially stands out is in Do It Yourself installation. </p>
