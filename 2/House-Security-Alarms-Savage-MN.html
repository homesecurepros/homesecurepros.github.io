However, you do need to register for the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get notifies on your phone if the sensing units have actually been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are readily available that have essential fobs and extra sensing units, too.</p>
