The variety of infrared LEDs used in a camera identifies how far your outdoor security camera will have the ability to plainly reveal what's outside your home.

<p>Another consideration with wireless home security systems is the limited variety of sensing units. Most radio frequencies are weak outside a variety of 500 feet.

<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the very same spot and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had set up on the porch by a certified electrician (who happens to be my partner). All of the cameras were connected to the very same 2.4 GHz network by means of a Wi-Fi router inside your home (roughly 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>

Being able to distinguish between a car and an individual, for example, enables you to reduce unnecessary informs.
