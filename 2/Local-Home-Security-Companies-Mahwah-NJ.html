Huge investments by the similarity Google-owned Nest, Amazon's Blink, and up-and-coming security company Ring have actually made home security cameras more popular.</p>
<p>Lots of security companies outsource their monitoring service to 3rd celebrations - causing outages, communication breakdown, and delays in reaction time. Unlike Nest, TP-Link does not make you sign up for a feature strategy to get the most out of the Kasa Webcam Outdoor.

When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>
