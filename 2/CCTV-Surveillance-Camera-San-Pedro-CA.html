<p>Nest Secure offers loads of clever gadgetry-- so much so that you may get overwhelmed by all of the choices. But hey, Nest is owned by Google, so we 'd anticipate nothing less! We truly enjoyed utilizing Nest Secure for home protection and automation, but bear in mind that it can get pricey if you don't already have a Nest smart home ecosystem set up. If you're going back to square one, we 'd probably suggest a company like Vivint, ADT, or Frontpoint.</p>
<p>There's a main 100db siren here too (silenced by the top button) which could be handy if your cameras are all installed outside - and doing so isn't a problem, with each carrying an IP65 score that indicates they'll stand up to a jet from a hose. For fixing, you have the alternative of either a strong magnetic ball mount or a basic tripod screw.</p>
