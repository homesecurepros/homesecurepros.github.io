Despite that, the alarm must suffice to scare away burglars for the most part.

<p>SimpliSafe equipment covers the essentials. But while ADT systems work with Z-Wave devices, SimpliSafe systems do not. This seriously limits your alternatives for syncing a SimpliSafe system with third-party clever home gadgets like lights, locks, thermostats, and outlets. If you currently have a security device from another brand, like a Blink XT camera, it most likely won't work with your SimpliSafe system.</p>
<p>Integrations are more than almost benefit. There are also integrations that can enhance your home's security.
