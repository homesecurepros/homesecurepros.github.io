The one time where lag does become a bit of a problem is in between tape-recording and identifying motion. Since the Pro 2 doesn't do continuous video recording, it takes a 2nd for the camera to really turn on when it finds motion.

Spending for the equipment in advance supplies you with a great deal of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you utilize the service. And you can stop the monitoring and start service as many times as you desire.</p>
