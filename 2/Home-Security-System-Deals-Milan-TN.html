Methods included searches of electronic bibliographic databases, manual searches of CCTV evaluation research study bibliographies, forward searches of CCTV examinations, and contacting leading scientists to inquire about upcoming evaluations. Both released and unpublished reports were included in the search, which was not limited to the English language and was worldwide in scope.</p>
