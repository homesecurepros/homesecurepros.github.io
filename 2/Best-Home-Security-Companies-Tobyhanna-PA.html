As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular given that the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
