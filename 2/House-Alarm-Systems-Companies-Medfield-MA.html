<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
<p>Our experience with professional installation was blended. Our tester said the service technician offered strong customer service: He dropped a couple of unnecessary window sensors from my expense after choosing that the motion detector was sufficient for the entire front half of my home." However, there were some concerns with connecting the command center to our tester's network. </p>
