Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 each year) to save 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we typically found action missing out on, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
