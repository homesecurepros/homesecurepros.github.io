<p>Just recently, Ring denied reports that it had suffered a data breach, but we agree with its recommendation that users ought to reset passwords and enable two-factor authentication as a precautionary measure. All smart-home gadgets are vulnerable to such occurrences. However, after this newest entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have decided to pull our suggestion of Ring's video doorbells. If you prepare to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially check out the What about Ring? area from our clever video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it comes to video items, we do not think that these issues modify the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain confident in our present recommendation.</p>
