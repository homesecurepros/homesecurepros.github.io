<p>When installing cameras inside your house isn't an alternative, you may wish to explore hidden cameras, which are cameras that are small and discreet, in some cases suited daily items such as clocks, smoke detectors, and magnets.

<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>
<p>We liked Alder for their fast response times and total adaptability. And managing our system with their touchscreen panel was quite darn and effortless streamlined.
