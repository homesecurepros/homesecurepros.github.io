We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest).

When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which travel through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Normally, the most intense frequencies produced are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the kind of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.</p>
