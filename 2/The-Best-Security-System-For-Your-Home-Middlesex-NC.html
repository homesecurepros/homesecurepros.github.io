<p>Nothing is more vital than protecting what you treasure most ... your family and home. You do not have to invest in a multi-million dollar surveillance system to keep an eye on your home and belongings.

<p>Nevermind how terrific the cameras are. The first concern you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your information to third party companies?
