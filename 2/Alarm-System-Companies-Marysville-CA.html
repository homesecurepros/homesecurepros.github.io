<p>Establishing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or residential property is the responsibility of the whole community. And it doesn't cost that a lot more to dress up your system with doorbell cameras, floodlights, and outdoor security cameras. Plus you can include extras like flood and freeze sensing units, smoke and carbon monoxide monitors, and panic buttons. No, we have security systems that use wireless, cellular innovation. If you choose to use a landline, we can still back up your system with wireless technology in case your phone service is interfered with.</p>
<p>Surveillance systems present law enforcement "bad apples" with an appealing chance for criminal abuse. In 1997, for instance, a top-level cops authorities in Washington, DC was captured utilizing authorities databases to collect information on customers of a gay club.

Imagine what somebody like that might do with a citywide spy-camera system.</p>
