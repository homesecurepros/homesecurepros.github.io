<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it offers protection only when the wireless device is "off the air".

In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just an incorrect complacency given that it avoids only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
