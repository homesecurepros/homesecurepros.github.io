<p>Secluded Areas - If a location around your business is remote, possibilities are unsavory characters are going to pick up on that, making these areas popular for preparing and bring out theft. One typical location is near a dumpster-an employee might throw away the stolen goods only to retrieve them later or send an accomplice for the retrieval. Security cameras present near a dumpster can deter this activity.</p>
<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see in the evening. If catching video in the dark is a priority, ensure your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>
<p>What really sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be costly but is important. In reality, we do not advise purchasing this camera at all unless you prepare to add the subscription. Without it, you won't get the person-detection feature, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, an in-depth, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera spotted activity. Having the ability to compare a person and a car, for example, enables you to cut down on unnecessary signals. And Activity Zones are a good perk, specifically if you're aiming to monitor a specific corner of the lawn, a doorway, or even trash bin. </p>
