When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>

Modern systems now have incredible capabilities", though these have produced reasonable misgivings about the danger for personal privacy and prospective abuse such abilities produce.

<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most highly sophisticated outdoor camera we've tested. It has a close-up tracking feature, which instantly zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high dynamic variety), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare general motion and individuals, so it reduces incorrect alarms, and it can even determine people you've labeled (after a knowing duration). However like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
<p>Fixed-mount security cameras are non-discriminating in what they record; everything within their focus ability is caught. That is to state, CCTV cameras are pretty un-focused when it concerns separating the images of an active occurrence about to occur. But you can't buy this camera on its own-- you need to add to a complete Vivint home security system. </p>
