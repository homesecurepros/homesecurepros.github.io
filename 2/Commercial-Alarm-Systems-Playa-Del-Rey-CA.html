<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it offers protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software to detect it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just a false sense of security since it prevents only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
