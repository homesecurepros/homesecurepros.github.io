<p>Do burglar alarms represent break-in decreases in the United States? The U.S. robbery rate has decreased steadily and considerably since the early 1980s. 13 Throughout the exact same time, the number of premises with alarms rose, however there is no evidence of a link in between the two. Throughout the 1990s through 2004, when alarm ownership experienced a high rise, other types of crime declined just as greatly as robbery, recommending that aspects other than an increase in the number of alarm fueled the break-in decrease.</p>
<p>Our experience with expert installation was mixed. Our tester said the specialist provided solid customer care: He dropped a couple of unnecessary window sensing units from my expense after choosing that the motion detector was sufficient for the entire front half of my home." However, there were some concerns with connecting the command center to our tester's network. </p>
