<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely regular given that the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as clients recognize that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
