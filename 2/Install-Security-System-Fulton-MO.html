<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we might point them at the same area and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had set up on the patio by a certified electrical expert (who happens to be my hubby).

We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to distinguish predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to determine faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also supply a broader variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
