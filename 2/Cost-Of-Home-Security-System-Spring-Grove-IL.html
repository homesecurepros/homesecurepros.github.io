<p>Nothing is more vital than protecting what you treasure most ... your household and home. The implicit reason for the recent push to increase video surveillance is the risk of terrorist attacks. But suicide assailants are clearly not hindered by camera - and may even be drawn in to the television protection cameras can ensure - and the cost of a substantial video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up around 20 percent of that country's criminal justice budget - far goes beyond the limited advantages that the system might provide in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the fact (see reality sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
<p>The most significant downside of SmartThings is that there's no camera.

<p>For these different systems to converge or to integrate them together into a single interface, a detailed understanding of all the required systems is essential. If there are no as-built documents supplying performance and configuration information to make this integration work, there are only 2 alternatives. The first choice, which might be the most complex, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial solution provider is reluctant or unavailable to supply those details) and record the topology and how they can be incorporated into the new DVS system. The other approach is to rip and replace, carrying out a total upgrade to a new security system that already has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to converge them all.</p>
