<p>Seattle's main intent with this law is to hold alarm-monitoring companies more accountable for incorrect alarms, and decrease the number of unneeded police and fire reactions. Alarm monitoring companies are the specialists and need to be teaching their customers how to effectively care and set for their alarm.

Initially examine the providers return policy and 2nd keep the receipt if you do buy them.</p>
