<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
<p>So what happens if something triggers your alarm but you remain in a conference with a supplier and you don't get the alert? Or what if you've finally gone on a much-needed holiday and your spotty cell service implies you do not get signaled up until the next day? The noise might scare off potential intruders-- if you're fortunate if your system equipment consists of an audible alarm. However the cops will not come up until you personally call them. </p>
