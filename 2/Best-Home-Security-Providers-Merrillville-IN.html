<p>Flood lights are typically used in combination with motion detectors. When sensors find motion, the lights illuminate the surrounding location, which will enable you to see who is on your home and will possibly scare off burglars. Better outdoor lighting also implies a clearer video for any outside cameras you have. When choosing flood lights, think about the brightness and distance the light shines. Flood lights can prevent vandals or frighten them away, however as a single piece of equipment, they are more for your peace of mind than for home protection.</p>
<p>Whether you choose to go with a DIY system or go with a professionally set up system, you'll have to pay a yearly or month-to-month cost if you require monitoring, and in many cases, you'll be hit with a regular monthly charge to settle the cost of hardware parts. With a lot of DIY systems, such as the SimpliSafe Home Security Set, the Ring Alarm Security Kit, and the Nest Secure, you acquire the hardware outright and can prevent any monthly charges if you decide to self-monitor. If you include monitoring, charges will differ: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 monthly for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 each month.

While the system does not provide the extensive series of voice command and home automation features as the most recent edition, Arlo Pro consists of integration with Google Home, Amazon Alexa, and other clever home services.</p>
<p>If I liked the look of the Nest, then I like the Hive View's style - definitely the most visually pleasing camera on this list. The good-looking glossy black cube, magnetically affixed to a brushed metal stand (mine can be found in a charming rose-gold but you can also get it in silver) strikes the ideal balance between subtle and attractive enough to not draw attention to itself.</p>

<p>While you need to pay for cloud video storage on the Arlo Pro 3, it's one of the more inexpensive subscriptions out there at $2.99 a month. This is an expensive security camera, but we think it deserves the investment. Increasing deployment of voice over IP technology (VoIP) is driving the adoption of broadband signaling for alarm reporting. Numerous websites needing alarm setups no longer have conventional telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with conventional telephone dialer ability do not work reliably over some types of VoIP service.</p>
