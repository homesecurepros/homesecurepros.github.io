<p>A tight wire perimeter security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to find any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensing units to overlook items that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to prevent this kind of attack.</p>

<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see at night. If capturing video footage in the dark is a priority, ensure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
