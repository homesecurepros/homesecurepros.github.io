<p>What actually sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be pricey but is important. In reality, we do not advise purchasing this camera at all unless you plan to add the subscription. Without it, you will not get the person-detection feature, personalized Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, a detailed, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera detected activity. Having the ability to compare a car and an individual, for example, allows you to minimize unnecessary alerts. And Activity Zones are a good perk, especially if you're wanting to monitor a particular corner of the lawn, a doorway, and even trash bin. </p>
