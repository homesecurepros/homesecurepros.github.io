HD motion sensing units will alert you when someone presses your Video Doorbell, when motion is captured or when an undesirable visitor does not press the doorbell. One of the best elements of these gadgets is that you can just hook them to your doors and windows without needing to use any tools. They can merely be clipped or stuck on the surface.
