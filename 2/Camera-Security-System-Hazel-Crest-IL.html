<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, many burglar alarms work the precise very same method. They use open and closed circuits to move an electric present. When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If someone were to unlock that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then trigger the alarm system. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door allows for the electrical present to flow throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the alarm system will activate.</p>
