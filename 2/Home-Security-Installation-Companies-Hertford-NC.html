One typical area is near a dumpster-a worker may get rid of the taken items only to obtain them later or send out an accomplice for the retrieval. Security cameras present near a dumpster can discourage this activity.</p>
<p>It's not almost security from theft, either. Adam Kostecki, the senior assistant vice president of digital services and development at Amica, advises sensing units that focus on things you would not otherwise notice, like leak sensors or freeze sensing units.
