Just like Vizzini's overuse of inconceivable" in The Princess Bride-to-be, home security companies like to toss around the word wireless" pretty freely. We get it.

Whatever the components are (camera, motion sensing unit, window sensor, wise lock, etc.), I want to ensure that they all quickly interact with your app that is always at hand, so you can watch on them from afar.</p>
