<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it provides protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software application to find it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only a false complacency considering that it prevents only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
