Typically you would find a PCB with lots of terminals or antennas for connections. Many also have built-in backup batteries for wired systems and a phone or ethernet line in or out port.

This camera provides a wide array of functions consisting of a 360-degree swiveling base. Last time I reviewed a Swann camera I described it as distinctly middle of the roadway. Not excellent, not horrible, but with an actually easy setup procedure (and trust me, that truly is a killer feature when it comes to smart cameras.) This newer version is much the same, to be frank.</p>
