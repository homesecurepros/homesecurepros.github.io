<h3>Smart Home Security Monitoring in Kentucky</h3>
<p>Bullet cameras are one of the 2 most common CCTV camera types. They have a long cylindrical shape, providing their name and a distinct appearance. This look is recognizable to almost everybody and therefore functions as a deterrent to unwanted individuals. The hope is intruders and crooks go elsewhere instead if security cameras are noticeable. That being stated, bullet cameras are more susceptible to vandalism because of their obvious appearance. Additionally, the shape of the camera is ideal for concentrating on a set field, such as an entry or exit, but requires several cameras if a user needs to see numerous set views. Bullet cameras are quickly mountable and can work inside or outdoors. They feature a small lip on completion of the camera that adds weather protection and reduces glare.</p>

For the ones that do not, you have the ability to see a live video feed of your home any time you access your system; however, nothing is tape-recorded.
