As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely normal since the doorway and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
