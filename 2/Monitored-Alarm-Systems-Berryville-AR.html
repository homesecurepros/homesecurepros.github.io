<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally regular because the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, when clients recognize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
