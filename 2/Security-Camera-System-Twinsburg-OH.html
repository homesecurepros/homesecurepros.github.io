<p>Many home security systems include Do It Yourself installation of surveillance equipment, so I make sure that that's a simple process.

We also experienced above-average connectivity issues, with 2 Hive test units detaching eight times over 2 months.</p>
<p>When you get a wireless self monitored alarm system, be sure to keep the base gadget in a central location so all the various devices are in close distance to it. It will tape clips when it views movement (and a couple of seconds prior to so you get the full view of what happened) and you can view these for a week before they're erased. You can extend the amount of days you get by buying a membership, however I do not think many people will need that alternative.</p>
