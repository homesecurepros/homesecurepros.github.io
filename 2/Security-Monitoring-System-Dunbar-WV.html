If a house owner forgets their keys and returns inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is triggered by an area cat, it can trigger the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the house owner will be called by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it quickly. Incorrect alarms take place.
