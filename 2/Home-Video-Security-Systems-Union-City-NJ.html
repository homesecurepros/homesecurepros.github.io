<p>As far as the app goes, D-Link has actually clearly attempted to give it an appealing edge, and we need to offer credit to its capability to show what's going on from as much as four cameras at a time. It can be sluggish and awkward to use on event - with the process of connecting to the camera for a live view rather languid at times.
