We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also pestered with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (up to 30 seconds) to link to a live peek, typically buffered, and had a reset function that left gaps of up to 90 seconds between videos.</p>
<p>No more keys. With distinct access codes everyone in the family-- or even visitors-- can reoccur while your home stays secure.
