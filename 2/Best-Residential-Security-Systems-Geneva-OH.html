These systems in some cases cost more up front for the hardware than professional systems that offer a discount rate in exchange for that lengthy service arrangement. Paying for the equipment in advance supplies you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. And you can start and stop the monitoring service as sometimes as you desire.</p>
