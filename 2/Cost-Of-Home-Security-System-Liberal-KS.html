Many insurance provider provide discount rates on insurance coverage premiums to consumers with operable alarm. These discount rates may be as much as 20 percent for commercial customers, and somewhat less for residential owners. 16 In addition, lots of authorities departments provide a number of "free" incorrect alarms before enforcing any fine, despite the fact that the cost to react is considerable right from the start. The deals of free monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurance companies cast doubt on the suitability of the present trend in U.S. policing of enabling three or four totally free false alarms per fiscal year, because they supply no up-front incentives to motivate owners to avoid false alarms.</p>
