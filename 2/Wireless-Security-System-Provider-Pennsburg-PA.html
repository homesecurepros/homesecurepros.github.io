<p>According to a report, homes that do not have a security system are three times more likely to be robbed. Brinks owns and runs its own US-based monitoring center. Its monitoring service includes a benefit called ASAPer, which at the same time messages a group of pre-set contacts to determine whether alarm activity is a true emergency situation or incorrect alarm. The majority of monitoring center call household members one at a time, which can slow action times.</p>
<p>When you wish to have the boundary secured, and still be able to move about freely within, you can choose to bypass the interior motion sensing units.

<p>There's a few other cool functions in the camera itself such as an automated zoom which tracks moving objects if it finds an intruder; a convenient intercom function that enables the device to act as a wise doorbell (although it doesn't have a chime or button - for that you'll require the Nest Hi doorbell ); and, given that Alphabet owns Nest, the camera brings Google Assistant.</p>

The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared with 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). Nevertheless, after almost two years of day, night and use images have always been clear, and we never ever had issues with the camera missing motion, an issue we experienced when testing the Wyze Camera Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a creative function you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It creates a green, on-screen box around the motion discovered. We have actually seen it highlight vehicles, mice, and moths.</p>
