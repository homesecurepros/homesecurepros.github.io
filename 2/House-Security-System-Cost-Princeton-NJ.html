<p>For these separate systems to converge or to integrate them together into a single interface, a comprehensive knowledge of all the needed systems is necessary. If there are no as-built documents supplying performance and setup information to make this integration work, there are only two choices.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally normal considering that the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as clients understand that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's generally far too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
