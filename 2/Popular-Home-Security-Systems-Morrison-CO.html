<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally regular since the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as clients understand that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
