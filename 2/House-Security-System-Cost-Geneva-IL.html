<p>Our burglar alarms may be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. As soon as the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to acknowledge a violation. When a zone has been breached, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transmits the message through a telephone line.

Going into the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and switching off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
