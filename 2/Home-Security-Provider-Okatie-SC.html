<p>One important exception: ADT has a landline monitoring plan that's $36.99 monthly, which might be a budget friendly choice for customers in backwoods.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally typical since the doorway and room appear to be at the very same brightness level.

HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
