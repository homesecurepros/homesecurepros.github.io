<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notices that distinguish between people and basic motion. We think that's costly.</p>
