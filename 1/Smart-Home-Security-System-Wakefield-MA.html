<p>Professional installation was almost the only way to put in a home security system 15 years ago. Technology has actually come such a long way that DIY systems can provide the same level of security (and frequently more) with a self installed system. Further, there can be additional benefits to a DIY system because they're usually much easier to transfer to another home if you move. For someone looking for a more complex setup like home automation, or someone that wants a trained professional to make the recommendation for the setup, professional installation is a terrific option. We've found that many people that were worried about self setting up a home security system actually ended up finding the procedure very simple. There are companies out there like Frontpoint that are known to be especially helpful in this stage.</p>

Similarly, it will equip itself automatically when everybody has left.</p>
