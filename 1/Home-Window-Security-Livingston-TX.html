<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to identify any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge.
