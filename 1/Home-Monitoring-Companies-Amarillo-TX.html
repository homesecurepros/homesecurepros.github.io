<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a malicious assaulter, because the disruption of the network avoids the circulation of information and actually indirectly safeguards data by avoiding it from being transferred. The normal factor for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, throughout which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, providing an opportunity for the destructive aggressor to tape these codes and use different cracking tools to examine security weak points and exploit them to acquire unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools available which can introduce a dictionary style attack of "perhaps accepted" security secrets based upon the "model" security key captured during the network healing.</p>
