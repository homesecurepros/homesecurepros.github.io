(You can protect that plug and include another 15 feet of cable television with the $30 extension package, or buy a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This indicates the Circle 2 winds up being more pricey total per unit than the Nest camera if you desire a weatherproof service. Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we don't recommend it since its battery-saving regimens can interrupt efficiency.</p>

<p>The Hive View provides great 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation triggered too easily, even when on the most affordable sensitivity setting. Because this camera has no native geofencing features, you have to by hand stop alerts (and recording, given that it does that even when notices are off).
