<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it offers protection only when the wireless device is "off the air".

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only an incorrect complacency because it prevents just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
