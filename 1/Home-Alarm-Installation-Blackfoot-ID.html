Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly charge (or $80 annually) to keep 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we frequently found action missing, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
