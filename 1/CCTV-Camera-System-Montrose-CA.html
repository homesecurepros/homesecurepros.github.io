<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the severe environment.</p>

Cameras that are not monitored by the central station can not be accessed our operators for any factor, even if requested by the consumer. </p>
