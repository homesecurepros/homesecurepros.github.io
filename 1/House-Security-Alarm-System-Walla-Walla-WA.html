<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely regular since the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once consumers realize that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
