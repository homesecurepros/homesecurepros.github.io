<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids speaking with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, false alarms are fairly typical. If a property owner forgets their secrets and returns inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is activated by an area feline, it can trigger the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the property owner will be gotten in touch with by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it rapidly. Incorrect alarms occur. With a self-monitored system, a property owner won't receive calls from a monitoring company. Rather, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the needed action.</p>

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within variety.
