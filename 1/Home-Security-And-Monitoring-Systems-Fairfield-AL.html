Nevertheless, you do need to subscribe to the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get informs on your phone if the sensing units have been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are available that have extra sensors and crucial fobs, too.</p>
