The technology gradually progressed into the highly advanced yet budget-friendly systems offered today. The very first uses of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the methods to tape video and see it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of requirement in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to enhance the outcome of security systems.</p>
