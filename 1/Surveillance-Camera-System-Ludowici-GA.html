We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage.

Likewise, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notifications that compare individuals and general motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
