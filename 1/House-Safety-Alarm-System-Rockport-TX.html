<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely typical given that the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
