<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely typical given that the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everybody entering the store.
