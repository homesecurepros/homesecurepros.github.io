<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your home so we might point them at the same spot and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had actually set up on the porch by a certified electrical contractor (who takes place to be my hubby).

<p>When using IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the big quantity of information required by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and often over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reliable, but not suitable with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, removing the need for additional electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might need less wiring in the walls however will still need cable televisions to power the security camera independently, typically through 110VAC power. </p>
