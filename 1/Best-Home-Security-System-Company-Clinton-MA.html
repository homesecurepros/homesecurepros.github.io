<p>Keep in mind that Nest cameras aren't expertly monitored-- that part's on you. (The rest of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.) However given that many retail theft wouldn't trip an alarm anyhow (a staff member slipping some extra cash while giving a customer modification, for instance), we think it's more crucial to have top quality images so you have the evidence you need. Which's what Nest gives you.</p>

<p>The biggest factor people decide to monitor their own system is to conserve cash. As mentioned, self-monitoring does not cost anything while expert monitoring has a month-to-month fee.

The minute you eliminate of signal range or turn your phone to aircraft mode is the moment you've left your house open. If you aren't cautious, this gaping hole in your security can show to be a big problem. With a monitored system, that would not be a concern.
