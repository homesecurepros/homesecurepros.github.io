<p>This Sansco design is an attractive deal. While the DVR unit itself is not particularly robust (its front-facing buttons are audibly 'clicky'), it records good quality video in Full HD with enough storage to give you around 2-3 weeks of playback video. There's two-way talking, fast actions to remote commands, quick zooming, and an adjustable field of view. The app is nice and slick, enhancing the camera's own cool design, and you can manage the Circle via Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit or one of Logitech's Pop clever home buttons.</p>
<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it provides protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software to discover it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just a false complacency since it avoids just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
