<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it offers protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software application to detect it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just an incorrect sense of security given that it avoids only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
