<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your house so we might point them at the exact same spot and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had installed on the deck by a certified electrician (who occurs to be my husband).

Hardwired systems need minimal upkeep, and except a basic power outage, are more difficult to interrupt. In spite of a basic improvement in wireless technology, there appear to be fewer ways for hardwired systems to be interrupted and immobilized. </p>
