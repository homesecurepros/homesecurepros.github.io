<h3>Home Alarm System Monitoring Tonganoxie KS 66086</h3>
<p>Several other designs were disqualified due to performance concerns. We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also pestered with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.
