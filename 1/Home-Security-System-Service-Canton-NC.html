<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to sign in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We first observed Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E Once we tried it out, it rapidly became a staff (and friends and family) fave. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send informs, you can't manage it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
