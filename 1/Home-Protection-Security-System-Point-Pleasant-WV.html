<p>As the name suggests, this alarm system is a starter package". So it's basically expected that it won't have actually extended customizability or a vast array of features. However, I am still disappointed that they have not included at least a basic camera with this kit. Cameras are pretty standard for self monitored alarm systems, specifically due to the fact that false alarms is a very genuine possibility.</p>

Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly cost (or $80 annually) to keep 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limits, we typically found action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
<p>Keep in mind 5 Three months of complimentary basic monitoring valid for one deployment in a two year duration. All credits will be collapsed versus any outstanding debits, and any remaining credit balance will be used versus future recurring service charges for all payment types.
