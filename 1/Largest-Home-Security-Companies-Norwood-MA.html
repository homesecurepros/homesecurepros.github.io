<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it provides protection just when the wireless device is "off the air".

In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only a false sense of security since it avoids only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
