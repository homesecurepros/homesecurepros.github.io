<p>We have actually all heard that old stating, you get what you pay for". This model from Samsung Wisenet will fit the bill if you're looking for a robust DVR system that feels premium and records in 2K quality. It ships with four smooth and white bullet-style cameras designed for indoor and outdoor use. They're equipped with night vision tech that utilizes infrared LEDs and wise IR to provide up to130ft (or 40m) night vision variety. Like others on our list, the DVR system works with a mobile app that lets you see what the cameras are seeing in real-time, though we found in our screening that the app sometimes forgot cameras which then needed to be re-added.</p>
<p>Years earlier, all alarm systems required you to have a landline phone which landline was used to connect your security system to the monitoring center and there weren't any other options. However, today, many people do not even have a landline phone due to the fact that they utilize their cellphones for everything. For that reason, a wireless security system is now the most obvious option for many people, particularly those who don't have a landline and don't want to rely entirely on their web connection.</p>

<p>Don't be tricked by the Nest Secure system's good appearances. It's an expensive system that gets more expensive with whatever you incorporate. Expect to pay an extra Nest Aware fee for every camera you install, including the Nest Hi doorbell. Monitoring is provided by Brinks Home Security but does not include fire service with the Nest Protect. And although we appreciate geofencing, we had several mistakes with that feature throughout testing.</p>
