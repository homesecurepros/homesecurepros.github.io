<p>ADT does not have the strongest customer service track record amongst the companies we thought about, racking up more than 3,000 complaints on its Better Business Bureau page While we chalked the majority of this as much as the reality that ADT has numerous million more clients than its rivals, our tester began his call with low expectations.
