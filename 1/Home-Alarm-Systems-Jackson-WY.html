<h3>Security Monitoring Companies Jackson WY 83001</h3>
<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive plan, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and features are practically similar to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's strategies are a little more expensive for the exact same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation costs are burdensome, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer suggest anyway.</p>
<p>What to think about: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 per month, but you'll pay a bit more if you want to include additional features, like a security camera. While a common agreement runs 42 months (among the longer contract terms on our list), that requirement is only for users who wish to lease their equipment. Vivint has no minimum contract requirement if you buy your equipment upfront.</p>

They cost more since they have to go through confirmation with the Underwriters Laboratories (UL), an independent, non-profit company that specializes in testing product and services to guarantee optimum reliability and safety. </p>
