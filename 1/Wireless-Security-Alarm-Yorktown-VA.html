When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.

<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we might point them at the same area and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting components, which I had installed on the patio by a licensed electrical contractor (who takes place to be my husband). All of the cameras were connected to the very same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router inside your home (approximately 40 feet from the cameras); service to your house was Verizon Fios.</p>
