In a network injection attack, a hacker can utilize access points that are exposed to non-filtered network traffic, specifically broadcasting network traffic such as Covering Tree" (802.1 D), OSPF, RIP, and HSRP The hacker injects fake networking re-configuration commands that affect routers, switches, and intelligent centers.
