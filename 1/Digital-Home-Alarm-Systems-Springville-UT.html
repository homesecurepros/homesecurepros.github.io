<p>For these separate systems to converge or to integrate them together into a single user interface, a comprehensive knowledge of all the needed systems is necessary. There are only 2 alternatives if there are no as-built documents supplying functionality and configuration information to make this combination work. The first alternative, which may be the most complicated, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original service provider is not available or unwilling to supply those information) and record the topology and how they can be integrated into the new DVS system. The other method is to replace and rip, carrying out a total upgrade to a new security system that already has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to converge them all.</p>
<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
<p>The SimpliSafe equipment is now in its third version, with an easier and more stylish design for both app and devices. The base station is curvier and the sensing units are smaller, but the range is much better, promising connections to wireless sensors as much as 800 feet away. We didn't go that far, but we had the ability to set about 40 feet in various directions, through walls to areas in the cooking area and dining room. </p>
