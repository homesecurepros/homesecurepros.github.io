<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that compare people and general motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
