<p>You can set off the 80dB alarm if you do encounter a home intrusion emergency situation. I am somewhat dissatisfied by the volume of the alarm. At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food processor whereas lots of other alarm are as loud as 90dB or even 105dB. In spite of that, the alarm should be enough to scare away burglars most of the times.

<p>The Blink XT2 is small, runs on 2 AA batteries, and consists of a year's worth of complimentary cloud storage, and it records a better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smart device alerts and live views were painfully slow, and the range is bad. Likewise, if the camera is in the middle of recording, do not expect to get a live peek or make any settings modifications-- it can't multitask.</p>
