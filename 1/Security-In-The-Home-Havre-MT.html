<p>Various types of CCTV cameras. IP cameras likewise have additional functions that analog cameras do not provide, such as video analytics, which enable mobile alerts and automatic recording if there is motion within the camera's field of view.

Methods consisted of searches of electronic bibliographic databases, manual searches of CCTV assessment study bibliographies, forward searches of CCTV examinations, and getting in touch with leading scientists to ask about forthcoming evaluations.
