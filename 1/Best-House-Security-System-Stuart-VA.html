Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to ignore items that exert percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.</p>
