The one time where lag does end up being a little bit of an issue is between recording and spotting movement.

<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it offers protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software to find it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just a false sense of security considering that it avoids only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
