<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely regular considering that the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once consumers realize that the economical customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
<p>We attempted each of the cameras in multiple places around our house, varying from 6 feet to 30 feet far from our Wi-Fi router, which was linked to Verizon Fios service.

Although FrontPoint uses a wide variety of equipment and home automation items at a reasonable cost, the one area where the company especially excels is in DIY installation. </p>
