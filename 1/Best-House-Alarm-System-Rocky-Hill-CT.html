<p>The Google Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is the most technically advanced outdoor camera we've checked. It has a close-up tracking function, which immediately focuses on motion and then follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high vibrant range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between basic motion and people, so it cuts down on false alarms, and it can even determine individuals you have actually labeled (after a learning period). However like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
<p>What actually sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be expensive but is vital. In fact, we do not recommend purchasing this camera at all unless you plan to add the subscription. Without it, you won't get the person-detection function, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, a comprehensive, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera detected activity. Being able to compare a vehicle and a person, for example, enables you to minimize unnecessary notifies. And Activity Zones are a good perk, specifically if you're wanting to monitor a specific corner of the yard, a doorway, or even garbage cans. </p>
