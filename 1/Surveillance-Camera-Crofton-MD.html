If you include monitoring, fees will vary: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 each month for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 each month. The rate of the Nest service drops to $19 per month if you devote to a three-year agreement. Ring's Protect Plus plan chooses $10 each month and doesn't require an agreement.</p>

<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching video in the dark is a concern.</p>
