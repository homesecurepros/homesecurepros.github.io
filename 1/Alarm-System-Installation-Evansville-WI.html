It can be sluggish and awkward to use on occasion - with the procedure of connecting to the camera for a live view rather languid at times. The previous, more affordable variation of the outdoor Nest camera is still on sale too if you want to save some money - it does have actually a cable television connected however, instead of working wirelessly, which implies it's a bit much easier to sabotage for prospective burglars.
