<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely typical considering that the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients understand that the economical consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
