We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
