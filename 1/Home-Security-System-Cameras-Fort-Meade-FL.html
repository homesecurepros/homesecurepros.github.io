Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just a false sense of security given that it avoids just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
