When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If someone were to unlock that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then trigger the alarm system. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking allows for the electrical existing to flow throughout the system, which implies when the doors are shut the alarm system will activate.</p>
