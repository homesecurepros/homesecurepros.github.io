<p>Numerous other models were disqualified due to efficiency problems. We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was likewise pestered with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (up to 30 seconds) to connect to a live peek, typically buffered, and had a reset function that left spaces of up to 90 seconds in between videos.</p>

Knowing the home is safeguarded can be sufficient to delay would-be thieves.

<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can determine individuals the camera is finding utilizing face recognition.

We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to identify faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also supply a larger variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
