<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. In a network injection attack, a hacker can use access points that are exposed to non-filtered network traffic, particularly broadcasting network traffic such as Spanning Tree" (802.1 D), OSPF, RIP, and HSRP The hacker injects bogus networking re-configuration commands that impact routers, switches, and smart centers.
