<p>As far as the app goes, D-Link has clearly tried to give it an appealing edge, and we have to offer credit to its ability to show what's going on from as much as 4 cameras at a time.

The previous, cheaper variation of the outdoor Nest camera is still on sale too if you wish to save some cash - it does have actually a cable television attached though, instead of working wirelessly, which indicates it's a bit much easier to mess up for prospective burglars.

After a while, the camera will learn to determine those people and will send smartphone notifies with that information when they show up at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to identify faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) likewise offer a larger variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
