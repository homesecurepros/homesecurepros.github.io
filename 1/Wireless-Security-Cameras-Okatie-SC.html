<p>Because it's more complicated than it should be, we do not recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, notifies, and combination all need separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are stored for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 each year) to store 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we often discovered action missing, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
