<p>The Google Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically sophisticated outdoor camera we have actually evaluated. It has a close-up tracking feature, which automatically zooms in on motion and then follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high dynamic range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between general motion and individuals, so it minimizes false alarms, and it can even recognize individuals you have actually labeled (after a learning period). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
<p>What truly sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be expensive but is important. In reality, we do not advise buying this camera at all unless you prepare to include the subscription. Without it, you won't get the person-detection function, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, a detailed, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera spotted activity. Being able to compare a person and a car, for example, allows you to cut down on unnecessary notifies. And Activity Zones are a good perk, specifically if you're seeking to monitor a specific corner of the lawn, a doorway, or perhaps garbage cans. </p>
