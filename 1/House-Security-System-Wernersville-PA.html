We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that compare people and basic motion. We think that's pricey.</p>
