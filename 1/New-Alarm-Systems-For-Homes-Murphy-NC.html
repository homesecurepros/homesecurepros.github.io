<p>Get best-in-class security, plus wise home automation the entire household will enjoy. Professional installation with expert monitoring: Brands like Vivint and ADT expertly install and monitor your system-- you don't need to raise a finger or babysit alerts. Over my 25 plus year profession in the security industry, I have actually researched, sold, installed, and because we have our own main station at American Alarm Systems, saw alarm signals for more hours than I want to admit.</p>
<p>Cameras often broadcast video online, allowing operators to monitor security camera feeds remotely. In many cases, surveillance systems are paid for and operated by the cities themselves. But in other cases, organisations and citizens share surveillance camera footage with policeman. Just like any security system, the more equipment you add, the pricier it gets.

Keep an eye on your home, office, or shop with our video surveillance systems. Use a desktop, laptop, tablet or choose smart device to access recorded and live video protection from a secure IP connection.</p>

Appears like a much safer bet to us.</p>
