<p>The huge perk is the 90dB alarm squeezed into a gadget that doesn't look like a home security system.

If you plan to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially read the What about Ring? section from our clever video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video items, we do not think that these concerns modify the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay positive in our present recommendation.</p>
