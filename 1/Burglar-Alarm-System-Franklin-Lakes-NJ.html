If there are no as-built files supplying functionality and configuration information to make this integration work, there are only two alternatives. The very first choice, which may be the most complicated, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial solution provider is reluctant or unavailable to offer those information) and record the topology and how they can be incorporated into the new DVS system. The other method is to rip and replace, carrying out a complete upgrade to a new security system that already has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to assemble them all.</p>
