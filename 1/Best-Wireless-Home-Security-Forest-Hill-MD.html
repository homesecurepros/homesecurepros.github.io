<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can recognize people the camera is spotting using face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those people and will send out smartphone informs with that information when they show up at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to distinguish predicted visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also provide a wider variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
