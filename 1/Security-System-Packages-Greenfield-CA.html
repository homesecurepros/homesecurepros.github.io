Then, beginning in the '90s, equipment costs and monthly monitoring prices started to drop, and they continue to drop even today. Outdoor security cameras inevitably cost more than their indoor cousins, because-- for starters-- the requirement to be secured from the components. TP-Link Kasa Webcam Outdoor KC200 impressed us with its low cost tag, ease of usage, and bang-for-the-buck efficiency.</p>
