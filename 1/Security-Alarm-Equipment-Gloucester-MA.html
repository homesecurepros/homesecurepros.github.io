<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it provides protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software to spot it.

In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just a false sense of security because it prevents only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
