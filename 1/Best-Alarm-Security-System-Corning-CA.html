<p>B.

When a patient presses the emergency button, it sends out dual notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Furthermore, if the main patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the threat and, if required, could just press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular flooring.</p>
