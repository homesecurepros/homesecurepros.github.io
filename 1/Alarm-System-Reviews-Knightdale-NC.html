<p>When using IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do these days - you will probably be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the large amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and typically over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reliable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for more electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may require less wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera separately, typically by means of 110VAC power. </p>
