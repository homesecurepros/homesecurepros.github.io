<h3>Security Systems For Houses Rio Rico AZ 85648</h3>

<p>When using IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the large amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and frequently over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reputable, but not suitable with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, removing the need for further circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might need less electrical wiring in the walls however will still need cable televisions to power the security camera independently, normally by means of 110VAC power. </p>
