While some cameras still let you view a couple of days of taped video, the pattern has actually been to only let you view live video from your camera unless you sign up for a subscription. That indicates you can't look back a few hours or days to see who was walking through your backyard.

<h3>Surveillance Camera Apopka FL 32703</h3>
<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to check in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We initially discovered Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we attempted it out, it quickly ended up being a personnel (and friends and family) fave. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send out notifies, you can't control it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
