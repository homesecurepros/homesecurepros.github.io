<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely typical given that the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when clients understand that the affordable customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
