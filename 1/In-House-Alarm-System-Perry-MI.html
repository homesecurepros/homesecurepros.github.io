<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced features, such as alerts that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
<p>The ADT Indoor security camera connects to your ADT security system to help safeguard your home. It's developed with motion detection, night vision and 720p HD video quality. When your camera identifies activity, you'll receive immediate alerts to see live footage from your smartphone. ADT wireless security cameras connect to a secure wireless network for secure video storage and playback.</p>

<p>I have this camera linked to my desktop computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able place the camera around 10 feet away from my desk aiming into my hallway. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which was able to find the camera without problem. The IR lights at night are able to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the rate and it does not consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>
