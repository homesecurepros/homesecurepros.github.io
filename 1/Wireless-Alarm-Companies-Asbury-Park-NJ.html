It will tape-record clips when it sees movement (and a couple of seconds prior to so you get the complete view of what took place) and you can view these for a week prior to they're deleted.

<p>The Google Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is the most technically advanced outdoor camera we've checked. It has a close-up tracking feature, which automatically zooms in on motion and then follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high dynamic range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between basic motion and people, so it reduces false alarms, and it can even determine individuals you have actually labeled (after a knowing period).
