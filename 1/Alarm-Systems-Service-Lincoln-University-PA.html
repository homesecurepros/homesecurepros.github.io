<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the big amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and often over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are dependable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for additional circuitry. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may require less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera separately, normally by means of 110VAC power. </p>
