It's easy to establish and, thanks to its magnetic, swiveling base, it can be installed practically anywhere inside your home. The video looks sharp; night vision is clear; the camera can be used as an intercom; and it connects with the Nest Thermostat and the Nest Protect smoke detector, in addition to many third-party clever- home gadgets.
