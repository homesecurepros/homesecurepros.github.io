The offers of free monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurers cast doubt on the appropriateness of the present trend in U.S. policing of permitting three or 4 free false alarms per fiscal year, due to the fact that they provide no up-front rewards to motivate owners to prevent false alarms.</p>
