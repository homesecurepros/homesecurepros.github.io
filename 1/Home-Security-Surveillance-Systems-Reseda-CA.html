It tape-records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is completely wireless, and can be established both indoors and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint doesn't have a contract, and its equipment rates is very sensible, so it's not a total splurge. However you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>

<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive plan, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and functions are almost identical to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's plans are a little more costly for the very same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation fees are onerous, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer advise anyhow.</p>

Given all of the other benefits, it's easy to see why a lot of individuals are picking this alternative. </p>
