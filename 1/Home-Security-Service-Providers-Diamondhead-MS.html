When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and typically through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Usually, the most extreme frequencies created are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the type of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.</p>

<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching footage in the dark is a concern.</p>
<p>What truly sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be costly but is necessary. In reality, we do not suggest purchasing this camera at all unless you plan to include the subscription. Without it, you won't get the person-detection function, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, an in-depth, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera found activity. Having the ability to compare an individual and a car, for example, enables you to reduce unnecessary informs. And Activity Zones are a nice perk, specifically if you're aiming to monitor a specific corner of the yard, an entrance, or even garbage cans. </p>
