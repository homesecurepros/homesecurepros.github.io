<p>When the alarm company representative has made an appraisal of your security needs, ask him for a composed proposal and a copy of the agreement you will need to sign.

However ADT isn't maintaining. It costs a lot, its prices isn't always transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to discuss that the customer service experience differs commonly depending upon the dealership you choose. </p>
