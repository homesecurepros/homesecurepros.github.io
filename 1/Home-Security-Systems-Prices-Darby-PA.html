<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely typical since the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when consumers recognize that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
