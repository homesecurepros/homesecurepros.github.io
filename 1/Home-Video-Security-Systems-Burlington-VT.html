The deals of totally free monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurers bring into question the appropriateness of the current pattern in U.S. policing of allowing three or 4 complimentary false alarms per calendar year, due to the fact that they provide no up-front incentives to encourage owners to avoid false alarms.</p>

<p>Some individuals would rather pay an alarm company the month-to-month monitoring rate instead of buying a self-monitored security system.
