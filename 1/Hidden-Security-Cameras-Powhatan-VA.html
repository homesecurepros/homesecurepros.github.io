<p>When installing cameras inside your house isn't an alternative, you may want to check out hidden cameras, which are cameras that are small and discreet, in some cases fitted into everyday things such as clocks, smoke alarm, and magnets. An individual hidden camera built into a watch or pen may be a good choice if you need to record an important conference in a public location. Lastly, if you simply wish to see what your employees depend on when you aren't close by, a hidden camera connected to a CCTV camera system may be the best choice.</p>
