<p>Among the best elements of this alarm system is that it has an extremely advanced motion sensor.

Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 each year) to save 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it supplies protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software to find it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only a false complacency considering that it avoids only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
