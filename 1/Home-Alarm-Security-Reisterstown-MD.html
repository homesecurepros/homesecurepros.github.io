<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can recognize people the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those people and will send smartphone informs with that details when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to distinguish predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise found the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
