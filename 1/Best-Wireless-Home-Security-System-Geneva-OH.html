<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced features, such as notifications that distinguish between people and general motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
<p>The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, but it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has a great daytime image. In our testing, however, we discovered the motion sensor to be touchy, with dreadful night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are verifying with Arlo whether our unit was faulty, therefore we may revisit this evaluation.</p>
