<p>I discussed that all we would require to do is take advantage of any among the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which likewise included two-way audio, which camera would end up being the interface into the VMS system. When a patient presses the emergency situation button, it sends out dual alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. In addition, if the main patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the danger and, if needed, could just push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>
