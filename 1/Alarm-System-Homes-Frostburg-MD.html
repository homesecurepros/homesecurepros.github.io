Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there.

But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>

For starters, it looks lovely: the all-white style and black camera face are seriously spacey (if eerily similar to the AI in 2001: An Area Odyssey).
