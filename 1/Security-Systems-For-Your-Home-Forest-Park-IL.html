<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do these days - you will probably be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the large amount of information required by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and often over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trustworthy, but not compatible with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for further electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might require less wiring in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera separately, generally by means of 110VAC power. </p>
