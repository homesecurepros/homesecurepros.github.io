Typically, consumer-grade cameras are developed to work well when there is plenty of readily available light, and as soon as the lighting becomes missing or low (think sunset or nighttime), their pedigree begins to reveal. Since they have bigger internal video sensing units and higher-quality parts that can adjust and catch outstanding low light video, commercial cameras outshine their more affordable cousins.</p>
