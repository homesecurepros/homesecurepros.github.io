<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software to find it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only a false complacency because it prevents just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
