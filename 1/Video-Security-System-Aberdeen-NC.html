If there are no as-built documents supplying functionality and configuration info to make this combination work, there are only two options. The very first choice, which might be the most complicated, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial solution provider is reluctant or not available to supply those details) and record the topology and how they can be included into the new DVS system.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal because the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when customers understand that the affordable consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
