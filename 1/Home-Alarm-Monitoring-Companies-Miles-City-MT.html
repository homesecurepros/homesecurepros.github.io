<p>Cameras with built in wifi that speak with an existing network should be within 300 feet for optimum performance.

For instance if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of a concern however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on 2nd story wall, this would cause an interruption in the signal.
