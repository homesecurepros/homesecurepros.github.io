<p>Something that must be thought about when installing CCTV cameras is how they will be powered, and how circuitry will be run throughout the structure.

<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it supplies protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software to spot it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just a false sense of security because it prevents only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
