A good example is the Vivint system, which we've reviewed independently and don't suggest for most people.</p>

<p>I have this camera hooked up to my desktop computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able location the camera around 10 feet away from my desk aiming into my corridor. The security program I use is "blue iris" which was able to discover the camera without trouble. The IR lights at night have the ability to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the price and it doesn't consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>

<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were excellent in our testing-- during the day and at night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We must keep in mind that the camera would sometimes downgrade the image quality based on readily available bandwidth, which might vary throughout the day. Nest includes the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that may defeat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
