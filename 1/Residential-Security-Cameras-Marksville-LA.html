We initially saw Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E But once we attempted it out, it rapidly ended up being a personnel (and friends and family) fave. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a sound maker.
