<p>Really simply, the person at the door presses the button. You'll get a notice to your phone (you can also get a Ring Chime WiFi extender if you want a doorbell noise too.) The camera then streams a video-link to your phone (or Amazon Echo Show, if you have one of those) - and considering that it works as an intercom, you can then have a chat with the individual at the door if you so dream. Helpful if, for instance, it's the postman and you're out. You can instruct him or her where to leave the goods.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range".

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally regular given that the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
