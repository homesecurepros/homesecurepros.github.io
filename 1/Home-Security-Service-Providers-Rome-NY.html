However, the number of individuals you can add to the system varies for various companies. Most self monitored alarm systems permit you to include 5 to 20 extra users.

<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it supplies protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software to detect it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only a false complacency because it avoids only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
