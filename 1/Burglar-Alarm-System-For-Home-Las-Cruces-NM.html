We have actually seen 1-year, all the way up to 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we recommend contract-free systems if you do not wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting agreement (and who does?). Our pick: No contract.</p>

Alternately, if you do not have a home automation center, try to find a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth lock that comes with its own mobile app. Smart locks utilize basic pre-drilled holes and are relatively simple to install. Some designs use your existing keyed cylinder and deadbolt hardware and attach to the inside of your door, while others need that you eliminate your existing interior and exterior escutcheons and replace the deadbolt and strike hardware.</p>
