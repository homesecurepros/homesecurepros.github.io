<p>IP security cameras catch analog images and transform them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing abilities like compression and motion detection. The recorded digital video stream is then transmitted over a local location network (LAN) using Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable television to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which captures each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and review. The system can be set up to communicate by means of network or mobile app for seeing.</p>

A picture of that employee is presented on screen for verification (validating it's not a stolen ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, ensuring no tailgating takes place.</p>
