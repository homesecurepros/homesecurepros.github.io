Commercial-grade cameras are created and built for high-performance applications where failure is not an alternative; consumer-grade cameras are not. Normally, consumer-grade cameras are built to work well when there is a lot of offered light, and once the lighting ends up being absent or low (think sundown or nighttime), their pedigree starts to show. Since they have larger internal video sensors and higher-quality parts that can adjust and record excellent low light video, commercial cameras outshine their more affordable cousins.</p>

And while this is a quite basic feature in indoor cameras, two-way audio is relatively rare in outdoor security cameras.</p>
