<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive strategy, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and features are nearly similar to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's strategies are somewhat more costly for the same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation charges are onerous, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer advise anyway.</p>
<p>Siren Several one-box systems like Canary and Somfy come with a very loud integrated siren that needs to hopefully scare off burglars (or next door's feline). Anticipate to see more sirens, both indoor and out, over the coming year as the wise brands expand their varieties. If you get a billing for excessive false alarms, you might appeal it. Initially, we recommend that you phone the Napa Police Department Records Department to discuss your questions and issues. You might ask for a formal appeal hearing if you are dissatisfied with the results of this conversation.</p>
