When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.
