Like others on our list, the DVR system works with a mobile app that lets you see what the cameras are seeing in real-time, though we discovered in our testing that the app sometimes forgot cameras which then required to be re-added.</p>
<p>The biggest drawback of SmartThings is that there's no camera.

<h3>Security System Cameras in Ridgecrest CA</h3>

<p>Because it's more complicated than it needs to be, we don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, signals, and integration all require separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 each year) to store 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limitations, we often found action missing, thanks to lengthy and irregular spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>

When you're feeling old-fashioned, you can manage Vivint security with a keychain remote, the main control or a mobile app panel.</p>
