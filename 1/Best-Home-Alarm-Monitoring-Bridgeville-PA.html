When determining how much an alarm system costs customers require to understand that if they add more functions, the rate will increase.</p>

<p>For these separate systems to assemble or to incorporate them together into a single interface, an in-depth understanding of all the required systems is required. There are only two alternatives if there are no as-built files providing functionality and setup info to make this integration work. The very first choice, which may be the most complicated, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial solution provider is not available or reluctant to offer those information) and document the topology and how they can be included into the new DVS system. The other method is to rip and change, carrying out a total upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the capability to converge them all.</p>
