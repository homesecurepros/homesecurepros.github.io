<h3>Home Security Alarm Installation in Wyoming</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually found that battery life never ever matches the producer's statistics because this comes from tests in a regulated environment without continuous video recording, which is the biggest offender for brief battery life by far. We agree with you about Blink's superior battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, however its recording capability is a bit minimal to advise as a top choice.</p>
<p>During our testing, this compact camera tape-recorded sharp, 1080p HD images day and night, and its digital zoom worked for taking a more detailed look. We especially like this camera's large, 180-degree field of view, since you're less most likely to get a blind area wherever you set it up. For less than $400, you get two door and window sensors, one motion detector, and a video doorbell with two-way talk.</p>

<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
<p>Our experience with professional installation was blended. Our tester stated the specialist supplied strong customer support: He dropped a couple of unneeded window sensors from my costs after deciding that the motion detector was sufficient for the entire front half of my home." However, there were some problems with connecting the command center to our tester's network. </p>
