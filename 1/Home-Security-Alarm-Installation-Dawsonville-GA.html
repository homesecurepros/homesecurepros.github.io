Once again the sales people, or a minimum of mine, do not point out the 3 year dedication. I called their client service group and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not have to mention it, it's on you to check out the small print. I'm paying the lump sum, due to the fact that apparently they vehicle restore you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send out in a composed not by mail.

The highest photo quality of DVD is just a little lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>
