<p>DITEK's burglar alarm surge protectors secure your security system versus transient rises that can go into through A/C power lines, telephone lines and remote notice zones. A monitoring expert will contact you within 24 hr to discuss your home security needs. If you're concerned about privacy and would rather not store your video in the cloud, try to find a camera geared up with a microSD card slot so you can store it locally.

<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents speaking with someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, false alarms are relatively typical. If a property owner forgets their secrets and returns within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is activated by an area cat, it can trigger the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the homeowner will be contacted by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it quickly. Incorrect alarms occur. With a self-monitored system, a house owner won't get calls from a monitoring company. Instead, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the required action.</p>
