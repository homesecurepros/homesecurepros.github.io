<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally regular because the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as clients realize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
