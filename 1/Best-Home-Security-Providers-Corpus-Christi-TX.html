<p>As the name suggests, this alarm system is a starter kit". So it's practically expected that it won't have extended customizability or a vast array of functions.

If it's somebody getting up to no good, the camera will follow their movements and conserve the timestamp, so you can quickly find it in the future.

<p>No. Monitored medical alarms are not included in this new law. These alarms differ from panic alarms, which are covered. Panic alarms receive authorities reaction based on fear of impending injury or physical harm due to criminal activity, while medical alarms generally get fire reaction based upon an emergency situation due to a pre-existing (doctor-diagnosed) medical condition.</p>
<p>The downside? It's really simple to commit security errors that will leave your home susceptible. The moment you eliminate of signal range or turn your phone to plane mode is the moment you've left your house open.
